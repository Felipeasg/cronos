Anthony,

        Attached please find the data I used for my thesis. There are 6 
columns in the data set, and they correspond to the log-daily-returns of
the Deutsche mark/USD, Swiss Franc/USD, British Pound/USD, Sweden 
Krona/USD, Japanese Yen/USD, and Australia dollar/USD. The data starts 
from Jan 03, 1994 and ends at Sep 12, 2001, a total of 1927 trading days. 
Please let know if there is any information I could provide further.

Cheers,
  Philip
